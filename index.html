<h1>Sportsmanship</h1>
<p>Shantilal was skillful at playing cricket. Where the medical clinic is currently located on entering the village, there was a playing field. Here his batting skills would score fours and sixes. Swamishri would say: "Yes, we did play cricket, but not to the extent that it dominated our lives. We would play for maybe one or two months, not more. Then we came here to worship God. Actually, after coming here, his work of scoring boundaries still continued â€“ the difference being that the playing field was now replaced by the whole world, and the cricket was replaced by various Satsang activities. Once Swamishri recalled: "Just like kids now play football, we also used to play with a ball made of clothes. I would run with that ball and no one would be able to catch me." The vast and dark shade of the Khodi Ambli tree near the Hanumanmadhi Mandir also served as a playground for Shantilal. How many times that village dust must have been sanctified as on Sundays, Shantilal would come here with his friends to play games such as bhamarda, marbles, hutututu, kho-kho and ambli-pipli. Among those, he enjoyed the game of kho-kho most.
